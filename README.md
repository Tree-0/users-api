In your API repository, add a README.md file that explains your approach, key takeaways, and any challenges you encountered during the assignment. This will help your reviewers understand your work in detail.

users-api provides an api with two endpoints for accessing all users and accessing specific users by id. My approach is pretty standard compared to what was shown in the workshops.
This assignment helped me solidify my knowledge of how http routes and requests are structured, and what endpoints actually look like in code. It also gave me more confidence with protecting 
sensitive data and error handling. My biggest challenge was probably getting the database setup and entries added, as I kept needing to add/remove constraints and fix syntax errors. 
I also had some issues making sure I had all my ports straight, as I didn't realize I needed different ports for the express app and the database at first.
